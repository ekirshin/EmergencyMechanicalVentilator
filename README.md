# Emergency Mechanical Ventilator

### The project
This project is a response to an emerging requirement of ventilator units during the pandemy of COVID19. The project has been submitted to the [CodeLife Ventilator Challenge](https://www.agorize.com/en/challenges/code-life-challenge?t=ijPk3VV2JCbZn0uUJpmVUg), organized by Montreal General Hospital Foundation in collaboration with the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre (RI-MUHC). 
Here we are uploading materials that could potentially help others on their way to a design a ventilator for urgent COVID19 response. The design has been implemented as a prototype and tested for feasibility purposes. 

### Implemented components
The following are components that could be potentially interesting for other projects:
* Main air pumping mechanism
* System of valves for air circulation
* Mechanical system adjustments and safety valves
* Enclosure and overall system design
* Electronic system implementation using available components
* User interface built as a Windows application (UI based on a LCD is proposed, but not implemented)
* Power system (battery and a PC power supply unit) 

### Warning/Disclaimer
Although we succeeded building a working prototype, not all functions have been implemented and no verification has been accomplished within the allocated time frame. Therefore, we do not recommend using this design AS IS for operation with real patients. The design requires additional work in order to make sure it is compliant to all required medical device regulations and to make sure it is safe for clinical use.

### Acknowledgement
We would like to acknowledge companies Logix ITS and Sphereco for 3D-printing parts for our project. Without their support we would not be able to build a working prototype.

### Materials
Here is a short video video demonstrating operation of the prototype:
